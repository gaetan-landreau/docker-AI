Some Docker images and settings used for 3D Deep Learning research. 

## TO DO 
- [ ] Avoid volume binding for credentials in the `docker-compose.yaml`file. See how the _secrets_ feature works with Docker swarn or how GitHub token access can be created. 
- [ ] Add better authentification for MLflow server. (see how _nginx_ works )
- [ ] See how a new Docker image might be build with tensorRT.
